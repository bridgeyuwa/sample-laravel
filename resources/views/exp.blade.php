<h2>The Pathological Jealous Guy </h2>




So, young lady, you have met this guy....

He is a dashing young man, cute and well dressed. He is as charming as they come. Showy and stylish, he was all over you like bees around a honeycomb. You were only able to muster a little resistance to his proposal when he asked you out.

Deep within you, you knew you were "smitten" and love-struck from the first day that his two eyes locked on yours. Additionally, he's so romantic that he swept you off your feet. Furthermore, he happens to be an upwardly mobile guy with a stable career progress and future prospects. You are already grateful to God for ordering your steps to meet someone who could pay your bills. You have met your knight in shining armour .

Moreover, he has shown interest in marrying you and as far as you are concerned, he is a "husband material" - 1000 yards! 

However, there is a snag and you are bothered. He seems to be extremely jealous. And when he gets jealous, he feels no qualms hitting you real hard. Nonetheless, he seems to have the balm that heals your wound shortly after. He would kneel down to beg you and say all the sweetest things a woman's ears love to hear. He would promise not to repeat the act but you could fully recover from the last experience, he would do it again.

Again, you'd find yourself going through the same cycle. He would buy you gifts in order to appease you. He would gift you money. The combination of verbal and physical assaults on the one hand, and an exaggerated show of affection and gifts on the other hand leaves you confused. 

You love the attention and the gifts but you hate the abuse. Nevertheless, in no time, you find yourself making excuses for him....you cover your bruises with make ups and extreme make overs in order to present the façade of  being in an enviable relationship to your friends and family. You tell yourself and whoever cares to listen that  "he's a good man...he loves me so so much, just that he's very jealous... ". In spite of all you have been through together, you are willing to walk down the isles with him to tie the knot. 

Okay, Please listen up. To begin with, all lovers are jealous and it is okay. In fact, if you are in a relationship with someone who is not jealous at all, the person might not be truly serious with you. However, there is something called pathological jealousy in medical science. Some people call it morbid jealousy or Othello syndrome. This may be the problem you are having to deal with here.

In this syndrome, jealousy is taken beyond the bounds of what is considered normal. It is a psychological condition that can affect either of the genders. This syndrome is commoner in males than in females, even though normal jealousy seems to be commoner among female folks. 

Please take this from me. A pathologically jealous man or woman will make your life miserable in the long run. This is a given. You can take this to the bank. He or she would accuse you of cheating every passing moment even though you are not. He would go to unreasonably great lengths in an attempt to pin it on you. No amount of logical explanation or reason will ever suffice. For him, It is an unshakable conviction. He would send spies after you if he is not personally available to stalk you. He could resign his job so as to have time to monitor you. Every phone call you receive or make is suspect. He will constantly start a fight and you would be wondering if he ever gets tired. He will wear you out. 

Furthermore, a person suffering from pathological jealousy, whether male or female, tends to be aggressive. Many cases of violence occuring among couples could be traced to pathological jealousy in either of the partners. They can use weapons against their partners and they could kill. 

Although, pathological jealousy is a disease of the mind requiring intervention,

most cases hardly get to the hospital or receive any kind of treatment anywhere because they could conduct their affairs in a near perfect manner until sexual jealousy with their partner is in the picture. It's only those who have other elaborate conditions associated with it that will have higher chances of seeking help.

Friends, when it comes to the choice of who you will like to spend the remaining days of your life with, never allow yourself to be blindfolded by a woman's beauty or a man's charm. If you notice any significant feature of pathological jealousy in your would-be life partner, do not commit to marriage until he or she is willing to commit to treatment or getting help. 

Save yourself from future avoidable pain. 

Open your eyes wide!
